### Setup instructions

We are using the fantastic uv platform and setup should be relatively painless!

- Windows people, your instructions are [here](setup/SETUP-PC.md)
- Mac people, yours are [here](setup/SETUP-mac.md)
- Linux people, yours are [here](setup/SETUP-linux.md)

### Then for CrewAI Setup:

Windows PC users: you will need to have checked the "gotcha #4" at the top of the [SETUP-PC](setup/SETUP-PC.md) instructions -- installing Microsoft Build Tools.  
Then, you will need to run this command in a Cursor Terminal in the project root directory in order to run the Crew commands:  
`uv tool install crewai`   
And in case you've used Crew before, it might be worth doing this to make sure you have the latest:  
`uv tool upgrade crewai`  

Any problems, please do contact Ed - I'm at ed@edwarddonner.com or on LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/eddonner/

### Super useful resources

### API costs - please read me!

This workshop does involve making calls to OpenAI and other frontier models, requiring an API key and a small spend, which we set up in the SETUP instructions. If you'd prefer not to spend on API calls, there are cheaper alternatives like DeepSeek and free alternatives like using Ollama!

Details are [here](guides/09_ai_apis_and_ollama.ipynb).

Be sure to monitor your API costs to ensure you are totally happy with any spend. For OpenAI, the dashboard is [here](https://platform.openai.com/usage).

### ABOVE ALL ELSE -

Be sure to have fun with the workshop! You could not have picked a better time to be learning about Agentic AI. I hope you enjoy every single minute! And if you get stuck at any point - [contact us](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eddonner/).
