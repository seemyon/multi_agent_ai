**Serves:** 8 - 10  
**Prep time:** 30 mins  
**Cook time:** 30-35 mins  
**Difficulty:** Easy  

## Ingredients
### For the pastry
- 100g chilled butter (plus extra for greasing)  
- 200g plain flour  
- 1 medium egg, separated  
- 1 tbsp golden caster sugar  

### For the filling
- 4 sliced bananas  
- 394g caramel or dulce de leche  
- 300ml double cream  
- Dark chocolate (optional, for garnish)  

## Method
1. **Make the pastry case:**  
   Put the butter and flour in a food processor and pulse until it resembles fresh breadcrumbs. Add the egg yolk and sugar, and pulse again. Gradually add cold water until the dough comes together.  

2. **Chill the dough:**  
   Knead gently, wrap in cling film, and chill for 30 minutes in the fridge.  

3. **Preheat the oven:**  
   Heat oven to 190C/170C/gas 4. Grease a 23cm loose-bottomed fluted tart tin. Roll out the dough, trim to fit, and line the tin.  

4. **Blind bake:**  
   Line the base with baking parchment, weigh it down with baking beans, and bake for 15 minutes. Remove the paper and beans, brush with egg white, and bake for another 15-20 minutes until golden and crisp. Cool completely.  

5. **Fill the pastry:**  
   Spread half the caramel on the pastry base, layer with bananas, then cover with the remaining caramel. Chill in the fridge.  

6. **Prepare the topping:**  
   Whip the cream until thick and spoon over the tart. Garnish with grated dark chocolate if desired.
