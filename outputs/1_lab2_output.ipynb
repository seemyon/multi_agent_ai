       "## Leading AI Agent Frameworks  \n",
       "As of May 2025, the following frameworks are recognized for their capabilities and adoption across various sectors:\n",
       "\n",
       "### LangChain  \n",
       "LangChain is a versatile open-source framework designed for building applications powered by large language models (LLMs). It simplifies complex workflows by providing tools for context management, workflow creation, and integration with multiple LLMs such as OpenAI and Hugging Face. It is particularly well-suited for applications in conversational AI, research tools, and document analysis. However, it has been noted that LangChain can be somewhat complex for newcomers, requiring a steep learning curve to master its many features.  \n",
       "\n",
       "**Key Features:**  \n",
       "- Modular development capabilities  \n",
       "- Integration with leading LLMs  \n",
       "- Context management tools  \n",
       "\n",
       "### LangGraph  \n",
       "An extension of LangChain, LangGraph focuses on multi-agent systems that can collaborate and adapt to different tasks. It enhances LangChain’s functionalities by providing coordination tools for multiple agents, a visual graph-based workflow, and robust error-handling capabilities. LangGraph is typically utilized for applications such as storytelling, multi-step chatbots, and strategic planning tools.  \n",
       "\n",
       "**Key Features:**  \n",
       "- Support for stateful multi-agent applications  \n",
       "- Advanced error handling  \n",
       "- Visual workflow design  \n",
       "\n",
       "### CrewAI  \n",
       "CrewAI is a framework aimed at orchestrating role-based AI agents, allowing developers to create teams of specialized agents to tackle complex tasks. It features a role-based architecture which facilitates dynamic task planning and enhances inter-agent communication. CrewAI is particularly adept at managing intricate, multi-step workflows. Future updates are expected to introduce more sophisticated orchestration strategies.  \n",
